# What is it?
flash4libgdx, as it's name says, is a flash animation package for the libgdx game engine.

# How to use?
It's poorly documented...maybe you can read the examples.

# How it's implemented?
I have a blog post for it [in chinese](http://www.zenlife.tk/flash-libgdx), but you'd better to read the f*cking source code.

# Limitate
1. filter transformation is not supported
2. chip in chip is not supported ... 
3. shape is not supported

I use it for my own project...not strictly tested. Maybe it's buggy, use it at your own risk!
